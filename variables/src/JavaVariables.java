/**
 * Variables
 *
 * The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:
 *
 *    - Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields) :
 *			Fields declared without the static keyword.
 *
 *    - Class Variables (Static Fields) :
 *			A class variable is any field declared with the static modifier.
 *
 *	  - Local Variables :
 *			A method will often store its temporary state in local variables.
 *
 *    - Parameters :
 *			The important thing to remember is that parameters are always classified as "variables" not "fields".
 *
 * Naming Variables
 *
 *	  Every programming language has its own set of rules and conventions for the kinds of names that you're allowed to use, 
 *    and the Java programming language is no different.
 *
 *    The rules and conventions for naming your variables can be summarized as follows:
 *		
 *			- Variable names are case-sensitive. 
 *			- A variable's name can be any sequence of Unicode letters and digits.
 *			- Beginning with a letter, the dollar sign "$", or the underscore character "_".
 *			- The convention, however, is to always begin your variable names with a letter, not "$" or "_".
 *			- Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters.
 *			- When choosing a name for your variables, use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations.
 *			- If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters.
 *			- If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.
 *			- If your variable stores a constant value, the convention changes slightly, 
 *				capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character.
